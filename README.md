## Getting started

#### Adding to your project

`npm install --save kankyo`

#### Installed globally

`npm install -g kankyo`

#### With npx

`npx kankyo exec -- node app.js`

## Usage

### From the command line

```bash
$> npx kankyo --help

Usage: cli [options] [command]

Options:
  -q --quiet          Quiet mode
  -e, --env <env>     Specify the environment manually
  -f --force          If set, will ignore schema/required fields mismatch
  -i, --input <file>  Specify the environment file
  -V, --version       output the version number
  -h, --help          display help for command

Commands:
  init
  exec
  help [command]      display help for command
```

By using the cli's `exec` command, followed by your own shell command, Kankyō will load the environment and run the specified command with it.

e.g

`npx kankyo exec -- command arg1 arg2 arg3`

### Programatically

At the earliest stage possible, you can require Kankyō and call its `inject` method to load up the environment file into the current environment. As you would traditional `.env` files

e.g

```javascript
require('kankyo').inject();

console.log(process.env);
```

### Fron NPM scripts

Configure your scripts to run anything with Kankyo

```javascript
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "kankyo exec -- node app.js"
  }
}
```

## Environment file

Kankyo is configured using a custom [TOML](https://toml.io) file

The default file name is `.kankyo.toml`

However it also supports the following names as alternatives:

- `.kankyo.toml`
- `.environment.toml`
- `.env.toml`
- `kankyo.toml`
- `environment.toml`
- `env.toml`

## Generating the file

A file can be generated inside your project using the following command:

`npx kankyo init`

### Default Variables

Start by setting the default variables of your environment

```toml
[defaults]

hostname      = "hello"
database_name = "my_db"
```

### Configurable Environments

You can set any number of custom environments, here's an example of us setting a `staging` environment

```toml
[defaults]

# ...

[env.staging]

database_name = "my_staging_db"
```

When run in staging mode, the default `database_name` will be overridden by the value set under the staging block

### Options

* `env_var` - Set the variable name that defines which environment is used. Defaults to `NODE_ENV`
* `uppercase` - If set, will uppercase all environment variable names. Defaults to `true`
* `required` - An array of variable names which must be provided

#### Required fields

Under the `[options]` block, you can add a list of required variables

e.g

```toml
[options]

required = ["API_KEY]
```

An exception will be raised if that variable is missing during runtime

```bash
> kankyo exec -- <your app>

  kankyo:info Kankyo environment file detected: .kankyo.toml +0ms
  kankyo:info Loading environment +1ms
  kankyo:error Missing environment variables: API_KEY +0ms
```

This forces users to either :

- Add the value to the file (either in defaults or in the environment)
- Add it to the shell environment

```bash
> API_KEY=123 kankyo exec -- <your app>

  hello world !
```

##### CI/CD

This feature is particularly useful when dealing with critical variables such as passwords, api keys.

Your CI/CD platform can fill in those keys during deployment, and the error message keeps developers aware when working locally.

## String interpolation

Variables defined in the Kankyō file support string interpolation using the `"${...}"` format.

Example:

```toml
[defaults]

word_a    = "foo"
word_b    = "bar"
sentence  = "${word_a} ${word_b}"
```
## Full file example

```toml
[options]

env_key     = "NODE_ENV"
uppercase   = true

[defaults]

word_a    = "foo"
word_b    = "bar"
sentence  = "${word_a} ${word_b}"

[env.production]

word_a = "hello"
word_b = "world"
```

## Cross-platform

Kankyō is not limited to nodejs projects. The `kankyo exec` command can run any type of project

Example with Ruby:

Set the `env_key` option to desired key

```toml
[options]

env_key     = "RUBY_ENV"

# ...
```

and run your ruby project

`RUBY_ENV=development kankyo exec -- ruby program.rb`
